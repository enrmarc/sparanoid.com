<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/products/microsoft-comfort-curve-keyboard-2000-series/">Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000</a>, The whole keyboard is a curved shape, comfortable, ergonomically inspired contours, and it looks a little strange. It sounds lighter than my old Logitech keyboard. The bad is the keys feel a bit mushy, especially the space key.</p>
